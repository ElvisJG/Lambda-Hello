Hello my name is Elvis Gonzalez

I am passionate, lighthearted, and multilingual

I am currently not doing much, in terms of having a hobby - but i am searching and did find myself falling off of a climbing wall last week.
I used to love playing video games, but haven't found any i have been truly drawn into for some time. My favorite animal is the wolf, but not for the typical
reason (lone wolf, strong, etc) but i choose the wolf because they work well in groups and are intensely loyal to each other. And they look cool. Mostly that.
