Hello my name is Elvis Gonzalez

I am passionate, lighthearted, and multilingual

I am currently not doing much, in terms of having a hobby - but i am searching and did find myself falling off of a climbing wall last week.
I used to love playing video games, but haven't found any i have been truly drawn into for some time. My favorite animal is the wolf, but not for the typical
reason (lone wolf, strong, etc) but i choose the wolf because they work well in groups and are intensely loyal to each other. And they look cool. Mostly that.

Forget all that, JK this is alternate reality Elvis Gonzalez

I am lazy, have no interest or passion in learning and teaching, and hate cats >=(

I am currently doing a ton of stuff, and have never fallen from a climbing wall ;)
I love going outside and doing... outside stuff, and my favorite animal is
snakes, i absolutely love snakes.
